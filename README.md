# Calculus-library
Arduino library to provide basic calculus functions, including integral and derivative, for fixed-step sampled data.

## Basics
The classes in this repository are intended to perform basic calculus-like functions when a function defining data points is not available, only equally-spaced samples from either sensor inputs or calculations.  To calculate the integral over time or the derivative with time,
